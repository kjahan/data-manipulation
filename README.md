# data-manipulation
This is a collection of cheat sheets for data manipulation.

"numpy_cheatsheet.py" shows a number of examples of how to create/use numpy arrays as well as matrixes.
It's important to note that numpy arrays are much more efficient in terms of performance compared to Python lists.
