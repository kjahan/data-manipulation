# data-manipulation
This is a collection of cheat sheets for data manipulation.

numpy_cheatsheet.py: demos a number of examples on how to create/use numpy arrays and matrixes. It's important to note that numpy arrays are much more efficient than Python lists. For example, creating a numpy array with dimension of 100000 takes ~0.02349 seconds on a MBP (CPU: 2.9 GHz Intel Core i7, Memory: 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3). On the other hand creating a Python list with the same dimension takes ~0.50372 seconds which is 21 times slower!

pandas_cheatsheet.py: demos a number of examples on how to use and manipulate pandas data frames.
